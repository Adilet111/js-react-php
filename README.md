1. In Algo project I will proceed to add more sorting algorithms. I think about adding graph editor which will solve graph problems. To make it more interesting
I consider to add some OCR js library that will map hand drawn graphs into my possibly canvas.
2. In the maze game I need to add some interaction for the winning stage and difficulty level. I am planning on adding every Maze Generation algorithm from the wiki page 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm
3. ToDo project is my version of TODO followed by the tutorial from freeCodeCamp.org on youtube  I found to be useful. There is plenty of room for learning react for me
It is possible to add more functionality may be to use MERN stack

Future projects:
1. Create e-commerce website using php and bootstrap where people from my city can sell the cloth. Currently they use instagram for searching cloth and Whatsapp 
for ordering. 
2. I am thinking about project with receipts recognition using React-native.
